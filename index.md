<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

Welcome to my website!

I am Kangkai Wang (王慷楷), a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the [Guanghua School of Management, Peking University](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/), and I expect to graduate in June 2025. 

My research interests lie in leveraging large-scale datasets and combining design-based (reduced-form) and model-based (structural) approaches to explore topics in urban economics, environmental economics, and empirical industrial organization. 

Here is my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/itqq9284dkdvlexrhnpwx/CV_KangkaiWANG.pdf?rlkey=dxhyl23eriu8ksbbl4uyg3ym7&st=7bsjch25&dl=0).
