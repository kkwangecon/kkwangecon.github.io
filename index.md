<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About</h2>

Welcome to my website!

I am Kangkai Wang (王慷楷), an Econ Ph.D. candidate at the [Guanghua School of Management](https://en.gsm.pku.edu.cn/), [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) and I expect to graduate in June 2025. 

My research interests lie in leveraging large-scale datasets and combining design-based (reduced-form) and model-based (structural) approaches to explore topics in urban economics, environmental economics, and empirical industrial organization. 

Here is my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/s89fvtt4gfvcvcanpgscl/CV_KangkaiWANG.pdf?rlkey=glfaq5osoi8eud20wcipr2fy7&st=ml08ww08&dl=0).
